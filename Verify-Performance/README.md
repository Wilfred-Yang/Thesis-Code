In 'Verify-Performance' archive, the program verify the performance of 3 ANN-based systems ( Min-Max, Look-ahead N, Better-of-Two). 
To verify the performance, 1 million bay configurations are randomly generated. I have applied three heuristics to get the average reshuffles.
The program here will applied the 3 ANN-based systems to get the average reshuffles and compare with average reshuffles from the three 
heuristics. 'Verify-Better-of-Two' is for verifying Better-of-Two heuristic. 'Verify-Look-Ahead-N' is for verfifying Look-Ahead N heuristic.
'Verify-Min-Max' is for verifying Min-Max heuristic. These three programs test the average reshuffles between ANN-based systems and original
heuristics. 

The file of one million bay configuration is too large to upload on Github. Here is the link og google drive:

'Further test' program check each reshuffles of 1 million bay configuration and compare with the ANN-based systems. The objective of this
program is to check the performance of ANN-based system on each bay configuration. Some of them may be better, and some of them may be worse.
