Creating Better-of-Two needs output data from Min-Max and Look-ahead N heuristics to combine a new dataset. There are other programs 
applying two heuristics to calculate every reshuffle of input-data, respectively. The 'Two-method-comparison' program compare the reshuffles
of two heuristics and pick the less reshuffle (better performance) as the output-data. Thus, some of output-data is from Look-ahead N 
and others are from Min-Max in the dataset.
