There are samples showing how dataset is generated. They are 'Input-data-sample1', 'Input-data-sample2', 'Output-data-LA-sample', 
'Output-data-MM-sample', and 'Output-data-BOA-sample'.

In generating input data, I treat present situation of container bay as input data. In my study, I use 4-row, 6-column, and 18-container
bay. The idea of generating a bay is creating a 2d-array and the size is (4, 6). By shaping the size from (4, 6) to (24, 1) that matches 
the size requirement of ANN. 

In the thesis, containers are with integer. Thus, there are many possibilities for containers put in different positions. Cartesian product 
is applied to generate all possible container bay when number of container is less than or equal to 7. The program is shown in 
'Input-data-sample1'. Because the number of container bay will be too large for training the ANN when the number is greater than 7. For 
container >= 8, 'Input-data-sample2' randomly generate destined number of input-data without applying Cartesian product.
