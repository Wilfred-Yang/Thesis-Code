# Thesis-Code
The repository is for thesis code that I have made. The topic is 'An Artificial Neural Network-Based Method for the Container Relocation Problem'. Feel free to read the whole thesis: http://etd.ndhu.edu.tw/cgi-bin/gs32/gsweb.cgi/ccd=ovrEHS/record?r1=1&h1=1

There are 3 parts of code in my thesis. First part is generating dataset for training Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Second part is the code of ANN. Including forward propagation, back propagation, and other optimizers for training ANN. I don't use testing set to evaluate the performance of ANN. Thus, the last part is verifying the performance of ANN.  

There is a problem called Container Relocation Problem (CRP) when reshuffling containers. Assume there are couples of container on the bay. Each container is labeled with an integer. The crane needs to move out(retrieve) container by the order of integer. Containers are stacked on the bay. The crane only move container on the top of each column. If container 1 is under container 2, the crane has to move container 2 to other column that the crane can move container 1. The crane can move container from column to column which is called 'reshuffle'. The objective of CRP is minimizing the total moves (reshuffle + retrieve) that the crane empty the bay. Each container needs to be retrieved only once. Thus, the problem can be for minimizing the total reshuffles. 

There are many heuristics helping to reduce total reshuffles. I pick two heuristics in my study: Look-ahead N Heuristic and Min-Max  Heuristic. The two heuristics use different ways to reshuffle containers. I want to make ANN learn the logic of the two heuristics. With more containers on the bay, it needs more reshuffles to empty the bay. I turn every reshuffle as a data. The dataset is very large. It may not easy for an ANN model to learn all reshuffles that two heuristics do. Thus, I split the dataset accroding four features on the bay: present container on the bay, number of deadlocks, row of the bay and column of the bay. Here is the new term 'deadlock'.
